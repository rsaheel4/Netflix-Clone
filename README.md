## Project Details

Our project is clone of Netflix which is implemented by using React js, html, css for front end and Node js and express for backend. For database connectivity we are using MySQl database management system. Through our application you can watch trailers of different movie categories if you are an authorized user. There is also sign up option, through which you can register yourself. If you already have an account then by signing in, you can access the application. For maintaining the user accounts, there is database named user which has a table named login consisting of two columns 'email' and 'pass' that contain information of email address and password of user account.

## How to run the project

- Firstly, download the project, unzip it and open it in visual studio code
- Open XAMPP and start Apache server and MySQL server(for database connectivity)
- After that open and import 'user' database which is provided in the source code

```

- In visual studio code, open the terminal then go to 'src' folder by writing command

```
cd src
```

Now write the command which will start the server

```

```

- open another terminal and write the command which will start the application

```
